### **Present simple and present continuous**

### **Meaning and use**

We use the present simple for:

- things that we do regularly
- facts and truths 
- habits
- permanent situations

We often use adverbs of frequency and time expressions like **every day, once a week, on Fridays**.

_**I check** my email **every day**._ (regular activity)

_**Sheryl works** at the bank._ (permanent situation)

- We use the present continuous for:
- things that are happening now _–_ at the time we are speaking,
- temporary situations
- activities that are in progress

We often use time expressions like **at the moment, today, this week**.

_Just a minute. I**’m checking** my email._ (now)

_She usually works in London, but she**’s working** from home this_ week. (temporary situation)

_I’_**_m studying_** _Economics_ (activity in progress)

### **Form - Positive**

The present simple has the same form as the infinitive without 'to'’ for _I_, _you_, _we_ and _they_. For _he_, _she_ and _it_, we add **-s** or **-es** to the infinitive.

_They **live** in Rome.  
__Julian **starts** work at nine o’clock and **finishes** at five_.

The present continuous for _I_ is **subject + am + verb-ing** For _you_, _we_ and _they_: **subject** **+** **are** **+ -verb-ing.** For _he_, _she_, _it__:_ **subject** **+** **is** **+ verb-ing.** We usually use contractions (_I’m, he’s, they’re,_ etc.) when we are speaking.

_Can I call you back later? We**’re having**_ dinner right now.

### **Form - Negative**

The negative present simple is **subject** **+** **don’t** (do not) **+** **infinitive without 'to'** for _I_, _you_, _we_ and _they_, and **subject** **+** **doesn’t** (does not) **+** **infinitive without 'to'** for _he_, _she_ and _it_.

**_I_** _**don’t eat** meat._**_It_** **_doesn’t_** _usually **snow** in October._

The negative present continuous for _I_ is **I’m not + verb-ing.**  For _you_, _we_ and _they_: **subject** **+** **aren’t** **+ verb-ing.** For _he_, _she_, _it__:_ **subject** **+** **isn’t** **+ verb-ing.**
