**5-Year-Old Anna:** _(giggles)_ Elsa? _(knocks)_  
Do you wanna build a snowman?  
Come on, let's go and play!  
I never see you anymore  
[[Come out]] the door 
It's like you've gone away!  
  
We used to be best buddies  
And now we're not  
I wish you would tell me why!  
  
Do you wanna build a snowman?  
It doesn't have to be a snowman...  
**8-Year-Old Elsa:** Go away, Anna.  
**5-Year-Old Anna:** Okay, bye.  
  
_(Speech)_  
**8-Year-Old Elsa:** _(gasps)_  
  
**King:** The gloves will help. See? Conceal it.  
**8-Year-Old Elsa:** Don't feel it.  
**Both:** Don't let it show.  
  
**9-Year-Old Anna:** _(laughs, knocks)_  
Do you wanna build a snowman?  
Or ride our bike around the halls?  
I think some company is [[overdue]],  
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls!  
(Hang in there, [Joan](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Joan_of_Arc "Joan of Arc").)  
  
It gets a little lonely,  
All these empty rooms,  
Just watching the hours tick by...  
_(tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock)_  
  
_(Speech)_  
**12-Year-Old Elsa:** I'm scared! It's getting stronger!  
**King:** Getting upset only makes it worse. Calm down.  
**12-Year-Old Elsa:** No! Don't touch me! Please, I don't want to hurt you.  
  
**15-Year-Old Anna:** See you in two weeks.  
  
**18-Year-Old Elsa:** Do you _have_ to go?  
**King:** You'll be fine, Elsa.  
  
_(Instrumental break)_  
  
**15-Year-Old Anna:** _(knocks)_ Elsa?  
Please, I know you're in there  
People are asking where you've been  
They say, "have courage" and I'm trying to  
I'm right out here for you,  
Just let me in  
We only have each other,  
It's just you and me  
What are we gonna do?  
  
Do you want to build a snowman? _(sighs)_
